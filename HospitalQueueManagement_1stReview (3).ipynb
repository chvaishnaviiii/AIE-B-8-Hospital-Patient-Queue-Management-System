    "# Introduction:\n",
    "The Hospital Patient Queue Management System is designed to efficiently manage the arrival and treatment of patients based on their severity. This system uses a priority queue to ensure that critical patients are given treatment before those with less severe conditions. The system organizes patients in a way that minimizes waiting time and improves hospital resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why only Priority queue?\n",
    "A priority queue is a data structure that allows for efficient insertion and removal of elements based on their priority. In the context of a hospital, the priority represents the severity of the patient's condition. By using a priority queue, we can ensure that patients with higher severity are always treated first.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hospital patient queue management system, priority queues are used because:\n",
    "- Patients with critical conditions should be treated first, regardless of when they arrived.\n",
    "- It allows dynamic prioritization, meaning if a patient's condition worsens, their priority can be adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why Not Use Other Data Structures?</b>\n",
    "- Normal Queue (FIFO): Patients would be treated in the order they arrive, which isn’t suitable for emergencies.\n",
    "- Stack (LIFO - Last In, First Out): Would prioritize the most recent patient, which is not logical in a hospital scenario.\n",
    "- Linked List/Array: Searching and reordering based on priority would be inefficient.\n"

    "# OOPs concepts used in this project\n",
    "#### Encapsulation \n",
    "Encapsulation ensures that patient data and hospital operations are grouped together into classes, preventing direct access from outside.\n",
    "- Patient details (ID, Name, Severity, etc.) are encapsulated in the _Patient_ class.\n",
    "- Queue management operations (adding, sorting, treating patients) are encapsulated in the _HospitalQueueManagement_ class.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Abstraction \n",
    "Abstraction is used to hide the internal workings of queue management from users, allowing them to interact with the system using simple methods like _add_patient()_, _treat_patient()_, etc.\n",
    "- Users don’t need to know how the priority queue works (Min-Heap sorting happens internally).\n",
    "- Methods like _start()_, _update_waiting_times()_ hide internal logic but ensure functionality.\n"
